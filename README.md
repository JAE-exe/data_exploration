COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and exploring COVID-19 data using SQL. By leveraging various SQL techniques, we uncover key insights into the pandemic’s impact on different countries, including case trends, death rates, and vaccination progress.

Key Skills & Techniques Used:
Joins – Combining datasets to correlate COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) – Simplifying complex queries and improving readability.
Temporary Tables – Storing intermediate results for efficient data analysis.
Window Functions – Calculating running totals, moving averages, and ranking data.
Aggregate Functions – Summarizing data using SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and more.
Data Type Conversion – Ensuring proper formatting for numeric and date fields.
Views – Creating reusable queries for future analysis.
Objectives:
Analyze global COVID-19 trends by country and date.
Calculate death rates and recovery percentages.
Identify vaccination progress and trends over time.
Optimize query performance for large datasets.
Outcome:
This project provides a structured SQL-based approach to understanding the impact of COVID-19 through data-driven insights. The use of advanced SQL techniques ensures efficient data handling and meaningful analytics for informed decision-making.
